# Apropriate Solutions for All

## Stacey Amery Dela Sera, DH 110 UX/UI Design, 2022 Fal

### Design Statement
Zero Hunger is an important goal to me because in high school I led a class discussion on food deserts, food waste, and how to lessen food waste in our personal lives. My parents are also immigrants from the Philippines and stressed the importance of having good food to eat everyday. I would like everyone to have access to nutritional, whole food at a reasonable price because I recognize the impact it has on our minds and body particularly during the developmental stage of life.

### Research
I conducted a Heuristic Evaluation of FoodPantries.Org and CollegeOfTheDesert to understand the current UX issues of the website related to the topic. See more about [heuristic evaluation.](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-) After the heuristic evaluation, College Of The Desert needed more help as there was also more traffic on their website too. I conducted Usability Testing to test out realistic tasks with the original site and to collect empirical data too. See more about the [usability test.](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-A2-Pilot-Usability-Test) I also conducted a [contextual inquiry](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-Assignment-3-Contextual-Inquiry) to empathize with the targeted user and unpack anything else that I am missing for the problem. 

### Design 
With the data collected, I created a [persona and scenario](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH-110-Assignment-04) to envision the type of emotions they would face as they encounter the issue and have it solved as well. The two main features were created from the two personas. Next I drafted some low fidelity prototyping, for a rough idea on how the website would be improved and how users would interact with the finished product in multiple ways. To see more about [low fidelity prototyping click here.](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH-110-assignmnt-05-low-fidelity-prototyping) Here is the design process of the [main interface.](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH-110-A6-Interface-Design-System) Multiple fonts and accessibility audit-color contrast was used. Next, an interactive protoype was used with cognitive walkthroughs.
